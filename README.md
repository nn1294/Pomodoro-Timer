  <h1>Pomodoro Timer: Enhance Your Productivity with Focus and Breaks</h1>
  <h2>What is the Pomodoro Technique?</h2>
  <p>Developed by Francesco Cirillo, the Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that utilizes short, focused work intervals separated by brief breaks to help you stay focused and improve your productivity. Here's how it works:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Set the timer for 25 minutes (a Pomodoro).</li>
    <li>Focus on a single task until the timer rings.</li>
    <li>Take a short break, ideally 5 minutes, to refresh your mind.</li>
    <li>Repeat steps 1-3 four times.</li>
    <li>After four Pomodoros, enjoy a longer break, around 15-20 minutes.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Benefits of the Pomodoro Technique</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Increased focus and concentration.</li>
    <li>Reduced procrastination.</li>
    <li>Improved time management.</li>
    <li>Reduced mental fatigue.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Building the Pomodoro Timer Application</h2>
  <p>This application is built using the following technologies:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>HTML: Defines the structure and content of the web page.</li>
    <li>CSS: Styles the visual elements of the application, including layout, color scheme, and font.</li>
    <li>JavaScript: Adds interactivity and functionality to the timer, including managing time intervals, handling user interaction with buttons, and displaying the remaining time.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>By adopting the Pomodoro Technique and using this application, you can gain valuable tools to enhance your focus, improve your productivity, and manage your time effectively.</p>
